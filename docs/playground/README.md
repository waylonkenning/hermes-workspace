# Hermes Playground 🌐

> The agent MMO. A browser 3D world where you walk around, talk to Hermes Agent NPCs, run quests, level up, and meet other builders. Built for the Nous Research × Kimi hackathon 2026.

## Pitch

Docs are boring. Agents are abstract. Communities need shared space.

So **Hermes turns onboarding into a multiplayer RPG world**. You don't read about Hermes Agent — you *play* it. Five worlds, six enterable buildings, a town full of NPCs that explain memory/tools/routing through quests, and presence multiplayer so other builders are walking around the same Agora as you.

## Try it

```bash
git clone https://github.com/outsourc-e/hermes-workspace
cd hermes-workspace
pnpm install
pnpm dev
# open http://localhost:3001/playground in two browser tabs
```

For real cross-device multiplayer:

```bash
# terminal A
pnpm playground:ws            # ws://localhost:8787

# terminal B
VITE_PLAYGROUND_WS_URL=ws://localhost:8787 pnpm dev
```

## Demo flow (60 seconds)

1. Land on title → enter your builder name → "Enter the Agora"
2. Click the ground to walk into the plaza
3. Click Athena → automatically walks to her, opens dialog → take Athena's Scroll
4. Walk into the Tavern doorway → meet Selene the Tavern Keeper, Apollo, Iris
5. Exit, walk to Bank → talk to Midas about persistent agent memory
6. Open the World Map (M) → travel to Forge → fight a rogue model
7. Open second browser tab → see your other character walk and chat with you in real time

```

Stack: TanStack Start + React Three Fiber + Drei + Three.js, ws (Node), BroadcastChannel API.

No external 3D assets — everything is procedurally drawn from primitives so the entire 3D world ships in <250 KB and runs on any laptop.

## Stylized > photoreal

We chose stylized indie 3D over photoreal AAA. Reasoning:
- Browser. Single-developer. Hackathon clock.
- Anyone can join from any device, instantly.
- "Genshin-lite for agents" reads as intentional, not unfinished.
- Future work: Ready Player Me avatars + Mixamo animations + r3f-postprocessing for the next-tier visual jump.

## Multiplayer

Two transports run in parallel inside one client hook:

- **BroadcastChannel** — same-origin tabs find each other instantly with zero server.
- **WebSocket** — tiny stateless relay (`scripts/playground-ws.mjs`) for cross-device. Same wire format.

Wire schema (mirrors what a future Colyseus / Durable Object server will use):

```ts
type PresenceWire = { kind: 'presence'; id; name; color; world; interior; x; y; z; yaw; ts }
type ChatWire     = { kind: 'chat';     id; name; color; world; text; ts }
type LeaveWire    = { kind: 'leave';    id }
```

Deploy options for the WS relay are listed in `memory/goals/2026-05-03-playground-mmorpg/multiplayer-deploy.md` (Fly.io / Render / Railway).

## Credits

- Built on [Hermes Workspace](https://github.com/outsourc-e/hermes-workspace) and [Hermes Agent](https://github.com/NousResearch/hermes-agent).
- Inspired by RuneScape, PlayROHAN, Lost Ark, and Skyrim. No assets copied — everything is original primitives + Hermes Greek-mythology theming.
- Hackathon: Nous Research × Kimi 2026.
